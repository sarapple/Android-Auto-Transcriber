# Android App Transcorder
Android app that records wav audio and encoding it to midi, and the midi will contain left and right-handedness metadata. Then this midi data is visualized in sheet music form.
See a demo on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/CBnJVIhtzSw)

## Credits
- The keyboard and sheet music visualization uses code and reworked files from (since I could not find a maven repository) from [ditek](https://github.com/ankineri) on this [midisheetmusic](https://github.com/ditek/MidiSheetMusic-Android) app.
- The above midisheetmusic package also references [ankineri](https://github.com/ankineri) for implementing MIDI keyboard support
